# PetalWild master state

Updated 2026-09-22 after wave 1 capture and smoke.

## Active build

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Branch | `main` |
| Engine | Godot `4.8.dev6.official.8898c2b3d` (4.8-dev6). See `docs/ENGINE_VERSION.md` |
| Scene | `res://scenes/main.tscn` → garden |
| Save | Version 1, `user://saves/slot_N.json` |
| Smoke | `PETAL_SMOKE_OK` and `PETAL_RULES_OK` on this tree |
| Latest shots | `docs/screenshots/wave1_overview.png`, `wave1_jelly.png`, `wave1_lumen.png`, `wave1_stall.png`, `wave1_journal.png`, `wave1_night.png` |

This machine has no Vulkan surface. Godot falls back to OpenGL 3 / llvmpipe. Audio falls back to the dummy driver. Screenshots still save. FPS on a real GPU has not been measured.

## Working

- Title, three slots, settings, licence reader, pause.
- Orbit camera, tool row, journal, stall, trust page, F3 debug.
- Soil till, plant, water, fertilise, tend, pond scoop, home kit.
- Clock (6 game-minutes per real second), golden / mist / rain / night.
- Data-driven plants and nine jelly species. Bellhelp arrives for 3 mature Meadowbells.
- Chain continues through Bulrush, Reedic, Cirlark, Dusknip night-loam, Pegapear, Gushorn.
- Grab, drop, and throw on the jelly spring body. Mood and bond change.
- Lumen Peel, Bram Cobble, and Nessa Pod (Nessa waits for a resident Bellhelp and a home kit).
- Petal coins. Fertiliser purchase spends coins. Peach-tray proposal spends 8 only after approval, once a day.
- Save and reload round-trip coins and garden state.
- Procedural wind, pad, UI, squish, and harvest tones. No third-party audio.
- Sim LOD counters. Trust levels named 0–5. Only 0 and 1 can happen, and both stay in the game.

## Broken or not built

- The garden does not yet look like the concept plates. See the gap list below.
- Bellhelp’s blossom still reads as one glossy sphere in the close shot.
- Veg People are readable primitives, not an authored cast.
- No hedge rooms, no sun shafts, no insect or bird life.
- City, venues, and the agent civilisation are a single parish record (`data/district.json`, Hedge Hollow, phase A).
- Tiers 3 and 4 of the simulation are specified, not simulated.
- Trust cannot research, draft, or act outside the process.
- The CC0 demo is in the garden. A full tree and hedge kit is not.
- Large-text setting applies on the title screen, not live in the garden HUD.
- Smoke quits during `_ready` and leaks a handful of canvas items. The check itself passes.

## Agents

No parallel workers are running. A second wave committed to `main` during this integration (`c140089`). Its scripts stay in `game/` behind `.gdignore`. The running scene is still `res://scenes/main.tscn`. Ownership for the next wave is in `docs/AGENT_CONTRACTS.md`.

## Branches and merges

`main` is the playable Hedge Hollow scene: Forward+, Bellhelp, Lumen Peel, the stall, and the hedge rooms. A second grove import (Sunpetal, Cara, Kenney CC0 files, `scripts/presentation/`, `scripts/sim/`) is in the tree and is not the running scene. `cursor/opening-grove-parallel-a334` is an earlier side grove and is not compiled. See `docs/RECOVERY_MATRIX.md`.

## Assets and licences

Inter 4.1 (OFL) is the UI font. The Asset Quest Stylized Garden demo (CC0) is placed as flowers, grass, a bench, and a planter. Nunito (OFL) is in `third_party/fonts/` and is not the live UI font. Ledger: `ASSET_PROVENANCE.md`, `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`, `docs/LICENSE_MATRIX.md`. Hunt list: `docs/ASSET_HUNT.md` and `docs/research/ASSET_HUNT.md`.

## Higgsfield

Spent: 0. Remaining on the connected account: **367.46** (pro). Catalog check recorded in `docs/HIGGSFIELD_LEDGER.md`. No generation has been approved.

## Visual compare

Compared `docs/screenshots/wave1_overview.png`, `wave1_jelly.png`, and `wave1_lumen.png` with `docs/reference/petalwild_target_garden_01.png` and `petalwild_target_garden_02.png`.

The outer hedge is taller, and the hedge shader now pushes tufts through the top so the wall is less of a smooth tube. A lower hedge boxes the four beds, with gaps on the paths. CC0 flowers and grass sit along that wall. The stall has the CC0 bench, planter, table, and umbrella on the prop atlas, not flat stand-in colours. Bellhelp’s close-up is a lathed bell with two rings of petals. Lumen has a stacked leek stalk, a leaf crown, an apron, and a satchel. `PETAL_SMOKE_OK` still passes. Shots recaptured 22 September 2026.

Three largest gaps still open:

1. **Hedge surface.** The walls break silhouette more, and they are still one shaded volume. The concepts are leafy. PETAL-05 and PETAL-06: leaf cards on this palette, not a new scene.
2. **Bellhelp’s face.** The petals read, and the core is still a glossy lathe with the eyes off the surface. PETAL-03: seat the face on the bell and curl the petals.
3. **Lumen’s hands and the lawn.** The leaf crown is there. The body is still capsules, there is no seed tray, and the ground inside the rooms is one plane. PETAL-04 for the face, hands, and tray. PETAL-06 for ground cover and sun shafts.

## Next integration

Keep this build playable. The next pass stays inside the running garden scene, then recaptures the six shots. Do not open a side demo.
